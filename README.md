# NBA Database for the 2019-2020 Season

This database contains information on players, coaches, and teams for the 2019-2020 season. Information such as player names, coach names, team owners, team location, stadium names, team/coach wins and losses, player shooting average, player positions, etc..

The NBA.sql file is an sql dump, so there's a lot of 'junk' in there. Luckily, github has syntax highlighting so scroll down a bit to see the create and insert calls.
